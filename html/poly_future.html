        <p class="lead">Enrolling into SP was an exciting experience. Returning to having school after a almost 6 month break was refreshing, especially since poly is such a different environment from secondary and primary school. It took a few days to get used to the travelling, the laptop usage, the lessons, the campus, and the food, but I feel relatively at home here now.
        </p>
    
        <!--Content Paragraphs-->
        <p class="lead">The flipped classroom format has been 
            interesting to say the least, the huge emphasis on self-directed learning had me stumped at first,
            as I thought it was strange that I am expected to learn things on my own at home when I enrolled 
            in the school so I could learn everything at said school, but I now have adjusted and can
            see the benefits of this approach now.
        </p>
        <p class="text-light lead">Another perk of poly life is being able to eat at pretty
            sophisticated food courts. Here is my review of the food courts in SP

Bonus points for the convenience too."

        <h1 class="text-warning">My Future Career</h1>
        <p class="lead">The dreamjob for me would be video game development seeing how passionate I am about games. but seeing that there are limited opportunities for that in Singapore, that dream may not be very practical for me in the near future. With my IT knowledge and specialization in AI coming out of poly.</p>
        <p class="lead">I hope to be able to eventually achieve this sometime in my life, but I am also content with working in the IT space until then. There should be plenty of opportunities awaiting me, including machine learning among other IT related things. However, I have not put too much thought into my career yet, so I shall wait and see as poly life goes on.
